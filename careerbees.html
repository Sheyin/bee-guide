            <h1>Career Bees</h1>
            Career Bees is a Forestry add-on mod that lets bees be competitive with some of the more techy mods.  The effects are (supposed to be) active only on a given type of bee.  The Career Bees Curseforge site (https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/career-bees) has a list of all the bees and effects; I’m just going to mention a few things here.

Some bees’ effects will only work on an item on a Flower Pedestal.  These just have to be placed somewhere in the bee’s territory.  You can place as many as you wish, and the bees will be affected by speed/production upgrades.

Bee effects appear to work on the entire territory at once.  So everything in the area will be repaired at once, or take damage at once.  Increasing 

Collector Bee: Effect: Wombling (collects items)
This is a fun bee since it’s basically an absorption hopper with a (potentially) huge radius.  Only downsides are that it only collects items (not exp orbs) and there doesn’t appear to be any way to filter what it picks up.  It is handy if you’d like to pair with Police Bees though.

Miner Bee
These will mine ores anywhere beneath their territory range, including modded ones, so it is beneficial to increase their territory, speed, and production.  They will however leave gaps where ores have been removed, which may cause more dark spots.  The basic Miner Bee will act as if breaking ores with an unenchanted pickaxe.

Fortune Bee
These are an upgrade to the Mining Bees, and will have a Fortune effect when mined.

Silky Bee:
An upgrade to the Mining Bee line, these will produce silk-touched ores instead.  They will also mine things like the Lava and Water source blocks from Tiny Progressions.

Thief Bee:
Steals items from player’s inventories
This is more of a cute / trolling effect (unless you can find a way to exclude yourself from their effects!)  Naturally active at only nighttime, and not day.

Police Bee:
Kills hostile mobs w/ a slightly increased drop rate
These aren’t as productive as say, a fully upgraded mob masher, and it is difficult to control their area of effect, but they can provide a pretty decent range of protection.  An individual bee might only do ~2 hearts of damage a tick, and I _think_ it increases with more police bees.  A benefit and downside is that a police report is produced with every kill, and while cute to read, they will quickly produce a lot of clutter.  Great for killing things in inaccessible locations.
In an industrial apiary w/ the fastest production and largest territory, along with 4 territory upgrades, 8 production upgrades + an automation upgrade, they appear to have a roughly 100 block radius and drains 115 rf/tick.  They seem to bring back some items, but it appears that some items + exp orbs may be left behind as well.

Tax Collector Bee:
These are one of my favorite species of bee.  They will produce mob drops from hostile mobs in their territory, but without killing the actual mob, so you could have a steady supply of drops with a single trapped mob.  The downside is that they won’t produce experience (orbs, or the Actually Additions solidified experience), but if all you need is ender pearls or slime, this can be a decent method of obtaining drops.  Note that mobs, even name tagged, can be wiped with a /killall command.

Armorer Bee:
Adds a special defense buff to armor pieces placed on flower pedestals in its territory.  This buff will be incremented slowly over time up to 100%.  You can speed its effects by upping its speed. Note that it may not work on some modded equipment.

Sharpening Bee:
Adds a special attack buff to weapons, bows, and tools placed on flower pedestals in its territory.  This buff will be incremented slowly over time up to +5 attack.  You can speed its effects by upping its speed.  Note that it may not work on some modded weapons (ex. Thermal Expansion bows).

Repair Bee:
Repairs items on flower pedestals in its territory.  Note that some items flagged as irreparable will not work (anvils, Actually Additions knife, Extra Utility glass cutter).

Energy Bee:
Fills adjacent machines with RF.  These will only do about 2-3 rf/tick in their basic form, and are a bit underwhelming.  However!  If you modify their genes to have high production and speed, and add Production upgrades to their apiary, they seem to hit much higher amounts.  I don’t have a good way of measuring how much they are doing,

                    Career Bees is a Forestry add-on mod that lets bees be competitive with some of the more techy mods.  The effects are (supposed to be) active only on a 
                given type of bee.  The <a href="https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/career-bees" target="_new">Career Bees</a> Curseforge site has a list of all the bees and effects; 
                I’m just going to mention a few things here.

                    Some bees’ effects will only work on an item on a Flower Pedestal.  These just have to be placed somewhere in the bee’s territory.  You can place as many as you 
                    wish.  A bee with average territory is a fairly large area - if you're within say a chunk of the apiary, it should be fine.  Simply right click or pipe
                    items directly into the flower pedestal to insert/remove them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To increase the output of bees, you typically want to increase their speed and production, both with modifying their genes and apiary upgrades.  They would also be
                    affected by things like accelerator wands and temporal bees, though I don't want to encourage it because <strike>the server admin will kill me</strike> it's not healthy
                    for multiplayer servers.  Bee a good neighbor and don't accelerate everything!
                </p>

                <p>
                    From my own observations, it appears that bee effects affect everything within it's territory at once per (bee) tick.  So all hostile mobs will take damage, or all things
                    on pedestals will be smelted, etc.
                </p>

                    <dt>Collector Bee - Effect: Wombling (collects items)</dt>
                    <dd>This is a fun bee since it’s basically an absorption hopper with a (potentially) huge radius.  Only downsides are that it only collects items (not exp orbs) and there 
                        doesn’t appear to be any way to filter what it picks up.  It is handy if you’d like to pair with Police Bees though.

                    <dt>Tax Collector Bee - Taxation (generates loot from hostile mobs)</dt>
                    <dd>
                        One of my favorite bees, this will produce mob drops from hostile mobs in their territory without killing them.  (After all, you can't tax a dead mob)  It does not appear to
                        produce armor drops or Solidified Experience, but it does appear to get player-only drops like Blaze Rods.  So I found these to be great for guaranteeing a steady supply of
                        relevant drops with only a single mob.  The downside is that mobs, even nametagged ones, will get killed if a /killall command is used, so you may want to keep spare 
                        copies of mobs in a Mob Imprisonment Tool or Summoning Pendulum.
                    </dd>

                    <img src="image/police-bee.png" alt="Police Bee" class="show-when-small img-smaller">

                    <dt>Police Bee - Effect: Policing (attacks hostile mobs)</dt>
                    <dd>
                        This kills hostile mobs with a slightly increased drop rate, and is great for killing things in inaccessable locations.  They aren't as productive as say, a fully upgraded 
                        mob masher, and it is difficult to control their area of effect, but they can provide a pretty decent range of protection.  An individual queen might only do ~2-4 hearts 
                        of damage a tick, and this effect will increase with more Police Bees.  A benefit and downside is that a police report is produced with every kill, and while amusing, 
                        they will quickly produce a lot of clutter, stopping your bees from operating unless the apiary is cleaned.  From my own observations, they seem to bring back items from 
                        the normal loot table like Tax Collector bees do, but items that generate from killing a mob (armor, heads, exp orbs) are left on the ground.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>Armorer Bee - Effect: Armoring (adds an armor buff to your armor)</dt>
                    <dd>One of my must-have bees, since it stacks up with enchantments with virtually no cost.  The effect stacks up to +100% when they are done, and it is permanent.  Note that it may
                        not work on some modded equipment.  Must place equipment on nearby Flower Pedestals to work.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>Sharpening Bee - Effect: Sharpening (adds an attack buff to your weapons)</dt>
                    <dd>This complements the armorer bee by adding up to +5 attack to your swords, bows, and tools.  It is also permanent.  Nte that it may not work on some modded equipment
                        (Thermal Expansion bows come to mind).  Must place equipment on nearby Flower Pedestals to work.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>Repair Bee - Effect: Repairer (repairs equipment)</dt>
                    <dd>These bees are great for low-cost repairs.  It will definitely work on anything that can be repaired in an anvil; note that certain items cannot be repaired (Extra Utilities's 
                        Glass Cutter, Actually Additions's Knife, anvils, etc.).  Must place equipment on nearby Flower Pedestals to work.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>Miner Bee - Effect: Mining (mines ores)</dt>
                    <dd>These allow you to quarry ores beneath the apiary, anywhere within its territory.  It will also mine modded ores.  They will however, leave gaps where ores have been
                        removed.  The basic Miner bee will act as if breaking ores with an unenchanted pickaxe.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>Fortunate Miner Bee - Effect: Fortune Mining (Fortune III's ores)</dt>
                    <dd>An upgrade to the Miner Bee, it works the same way but will mine them with Fortune III.</dd>

                    <dt>Silky Miner Bee - Effect: Silk Touch Mining (Silk Touches ores)</dt>
                    <dd>An upgrade to the Miner Bee, these will produce silk-touched ores instead.  They also will mine things like Lava and Water source blocks from Tiny Progressions.
                    </dd>

                    <img src="image/energy-bee.png" alt="Energy Bee" class="show-when-small img-smaller">

                    <dt>Energy Bee - Effect: RF Inducing (produces RF)</dt>
                    <dd>These fill directly adjacent machines with RF.  These will only do about 2-3 rf/tick in their basic form, and are a bit underwhelming.  However!  
                        If you modify their genes to have high production and speed, and add Production upgrades to their apiary, they seem to hit much higher amounts.  I 
                        don’t have a good way of measuring how much they are doing,   
                    </dd>

                    <dt>Plague Bee - Effect: Curative (cures negative effects & slight healing effect to entities)</dt>
                    <dd>These do work, but I've noticed some... odd behavior if you're also affected by Environmental Tech's personal nanobots as your buffs seem to get
                        removed and reapplied repeatedly awhile.  If you're not using that though, then these are definitely awesome bees to have around.
                    </dd>

                    <img src="image/assassin-bee.png" alt="Assassin Bee" class="show-when-small img-smaller">

                    <dt>Assassin Bee - Effect: Assassinate (instantly kills active queens in nearby hives)</dt>
                    <dd>
                        This bee is great when you're just doing some breeding / just mutated a bee and want to have a princess and drone to modify.  You can insert this into
                        a Bee-Bee Gun for more dramatic effects.  The Bee-Bee Gun needs to be filled with honey to work - you can use an EnderIO tank to do this.

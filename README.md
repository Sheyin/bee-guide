# <a href="https://sheyin.github.io/bee-guide/">Shey's Bee Guide</a>
This is a guide written to introduce people to [Forestry](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/forestry?gameCategorySlug=mc-mods&projectID=59751), [Gendustry](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/gendustry?gameCategorySlug=mc-mods&projectID=70492), and [Career Bees](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/career-bees).  

Written for the [Options](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/options?gameCategorySlug=modpacks&projectID=319010) (v. 1.2.1) pack which has Forestry 5.8.2.387, Gendustry 1.6.5.8, and Career Bees 0.4.0.  As far as I know, all the recipes/mechanics are unchanged, so it should be roughly correct for any pack with these three mods.

Feedback / corrections / questions / suggestions are welcome!  I'm not an expert, just someone trying to help more people appreciate these lovely bees!

Credits for the mods go to their respective creators.  Please visit their websites for more information!

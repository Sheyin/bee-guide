# bee-guide
This is a guide written to introduce people to (Minecraft) Forestry, Gendustry, and Career Bees.  

Written for the Options modpack (v. 1.2.1) which has Forestry 5.8.2.387, Gendustry 1.6.5.8, and Career Bees 0.4.0.  As far as I know, all the recipes/mechanics are unchanged, so it should be roughly correct for any pack with these three mods.

Feedback / corrections / suggestions are welcome!  I'm not an expert, just someone trying to help more people appreciate these lovely bees!

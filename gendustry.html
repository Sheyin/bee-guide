            </div>
        </div>

            <div class="col-md-8">
                <p>
                The first machine you’ll need is the <a href="https://bdew.net/gendustry/mutagen-producer/">Mutagen Producer</a>.  This will 
                convert certain materials into liquid Mutagen, which is required to power the <a href="https://bdew.net/gendustry/mutatron/">Mutatron</a>.  I usually use Redstone Blocks for this, 
                but it does accept glowstone and <a href="https://bdew.net/gendustry/mutagen-producer/" target="_new">other materials</a>.  It will also 
                require FE to operate.
                </p>

                <p>
                The Mutatron is the second most important machine.  It will consume Mutagen to force a mutation and is a huge time-saver.  It also bypasses 
                all mutation requirements.  If you can afford to do so, I strongly recommend immediately upgrading to the <b>Advanced Mutatron</b>, which will 
                give you the ability to choose your resulting mutation, as some species have multiple results.  Note that the mutation process has the 
                <b>chance to kill ignoble princesses</b>.  I haven’t run enough tests to guess at the rate of deaths, but it doesn’t seem too high.

                    When mutating, it isn’t necessary to have a purebred - just needs to have that species as the active trait.  So if the bee is half 
                    Common, half Forest, it will be treated like any other common bee when mutating.

                Another set of Gendustry machines that is the Sampler and Imprinter.  Basically, you can sacrifice bees in order to get a copy of a specific 
                trait, which you can then use in an imprinter/template to alter bees.  So, if you want your bees to act faster, you’d want to obtain 
                bees with the fastest trait (you can look these up in JEI).  If you want ones with a larger territory / range, produce some of those.  Each 
                bee sacrificed will produced one gene randomly out of whatever active and inactive ones it possesses.  You can sacrifice princesses, but it’s 
                a waste.  Gene samples can be recycled by smelting them.
                </p>
                <p>
                When you have gene(s) you like, you can add them to a template simply by crafting them (one-by-one or multiple) together with a template.  The 
                gene is consumed and permanently added to the template.  <b>Blank characteristics in a template will not change those characteristics of the bee 
                it is used on</b>, so if you wanted to make your Rocky Bees have 4 offspring instead of the default 1, you could sacrifice Majestic drones until 
                you get the offspring: 4 trait, then add it to a template.  If you were to use this template, every characteristic would remain the same except 
                for the offspring, which would take on the new 4 offspring trait.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                The Imprinter is the machine that uses the templates.  Each imprinting consumed a labware and has a chance of killing an ignoble princess.  
                You will need to do this twice for each species you wish to modify (to create a breeding pair).
                </p>

                <p>
                If you want to copy samples or templates, you can use the <b>Genetic Transposer</b>.
                </p>

                    You can't put a queen into the Imprinter, so if you have a newly-minted queen produced by a Mutatron, you'll have to let it die

                    in the Industrial Apiary to speed things along, or an Assassin Queen in a Bee-Bee gun will instantly kill the queen.

                <h2>The Protein Liquifier, DNA Extractor, and Replicator</h2>
                <p>
                This set of machines works together to create new (ignoble) princesses.  The DNA Extractor requires sacrificing organic materials (drones, 
                saplings, etc) to produce Liquid DNA; the Protein Liquifier creates liquid Protein from raw meats.  Both of these are combined in a 
                Replicator, along with a full genetic template, to produce a new ignoble princess.

                <h2>So what do I do with these machines?</h2>        
                <p>    
                    A couple of the advanced bees will require it to be bred with one of its ancestors, or vanilla Forestry bees, so you may want to breed a 
                    several extra drones of each, just in case.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    You also may want to begin making use of the Imprinter to modify bees and introduce a shorter lifespan.  By default, many of the 
                    Career Bees have Long lifespans; if you are using the mutatron, you can simply stick the resulting queen into an apiary until she dies, 
                    then modify both the princess and a drone to have a shorter lifespan.

                        Majestic bees are easy to get the Shortened lifespan from, since they breed in multiples of 4 and are on the core breeding path.  
                        Getting both these traits, and putting them into an empty template (leaving the rest of the traits free) makes breeding new species/copies 
                        of drones very quick and easy.

                <p>
                    So if you’ve been going the Gendustry route, you’ve probably already made a few of these already.  There are 4 slots in the middle of each 
                    Industrial Apiary which can be used for upgrades.  Some allow multiple copies of a particular upgrade; each upgrade (including duplicates) 
                    will increase the RF cost.  I will cover the ones I use the most here, but a detailed list can be seen 
                    <a href="https://bdew.net/gendustry/industrial-apiary/upgrades/" target="_new">here</a> or in JEI: 
            
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Automation Upgrade: </b>
                            A must-have upgrade, it is great for mass-producing drones, cloning a bee (breeding a random princess with ~5-7 of a different drone), 
                            getting bee products / constant effects.  Once a queen’s lifecycle is complete, it automatically takes the princess and breeds it with 
                            whatever is in the drone slot, otherwise it will select a random drone from the output slots.  If you have pipes extracting from your 
                            apiary, this will breed the princesses first before it can be extracted.  However, this upgrade will not work if your apiary’s output 
                            slots are full.
                        </li>
                        
                        <li><b>Light Upgrade: </b>
                            Provides constant daylight for your bees.  If you modify your bees to be nocturnal, this isn’t necessary.
                        </li>

                        <li><b>Open Sky Upgrade: </b>
                            If you want to have your bees underground, you can either poke windows up to the sky or simply use one of these.  If you modify your 
                            bees to be cave-dwelling, this isn’t necessary.
                        </li>

                        <li><b>Seal: </b>
                            If you want your bees to work in bad weather, this can be used.  If your bee has the tolerates rain trait, this isn’t necessary.
                        </li>

                        <li><b>Lifespan: </b>
                            These are great when creating new species, or waiting out newly-mutated queens.  You can have four of them in your apiary, and it 
                            will speed through the queen’s lifecycle without permanently changing the bee.
                        </li>
                        
                        <li><b>Territory: </b>
                            You can use this to greatly enhance your bee’s effect range; I mostly use these with Career Bees.  For example, having territory: largest 
                            and four territory upgrades lets bees reach about a 100 block radius around the apiary.
                        </li>

                        <li><b>Production:</b>
                            This will increase the amount of bee products/effects generated.  I use these with Energy Bees to increase the amount of energy filled per tick.
                        </li>

                        <li><b>Stabilizer: </b>
                            Great if you have ignoble princesses; these will let you breed them infinitely without worrying if/when they will disappear.
                        </li>

                        <li><b>Biome Overrides: </b>
                            I tend to prefer these over the climate upgrades, since it will take care of both temperature and humidity differences at the same time with a single upgrade.  
                            Also, some bees will want it very hot or cold, which means you would need multiple heating/cooling upgrades to achieve the right climate - or just use a single 
                            Hell / Winter Biome Upgrade.
                        </li>

                <p>
                If you’re doing Industrial Apiaries (Gendustry), it isn’t really necessary to know much about these.  Frames are basically the equivalent of upgrades, with some reducing lifespan, 
                increasing production, etc.  There are no frames that completely change the climate or daytime / sky / rain requirements; for this, you are expected to gradually breed more 
                tolerant bees by crossing them with species that have the desired traits, or use an alveary.  Binnie’s Genetics also provides the ability to modify the heat/humidity tolerances.  
                <a href="https://ftb.gamepedia.com/Getting_Started_(Forestry_-_Alveary)" target="_new">Alvearies</a> are a multiblock apiary that has a natural +100% production boost, and the 
                ability to modify the climate with special alveary blocks.

                <h2>What about Binnie’s Genetics?</h2>
                <p>
                It’s been a very long time since I’ve delved into Binnie’s mods, aside from some of the bees, so I’m not comfortable talking about it in 
                a guide.  The machines have been revamped and the principles look pretty cool, but I just haven’t taken the time to explore them yet.  From 
                looking at the wiki and from what I remember, there are similar options to tailor specific bees to your liking by getting specific genes and 
                acclimatizing their temperature tolerances so you can breed bees in a particular biome.  These can also be covered using Gendustry 
                machines (Sampler/Imprinter, throwing a biome upgrade or temperature upgrades into the Industrial Apiary), so if you are going the 
                Gendustry route, you probably won’t find yourself using them.

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            So, you want to learn about bees?  It can be a little intimidating at first, but it's actually quite easy to get started.  The official 
            <a href="https://forestryforminecraft.info">Forestry</a>site has a good lore-flavored guide, but I’ll also cover some details below.  
            This guide will also focus a bit more on Gendustry and Career Bees.  The basic principles of Forestry will be covered, but Gendustry tends to 
            take away a lot of the tedium (and surprises / challenges), so it’s up to you how you want to do your bees!
        </p>

        <h2>Why bees?</h2>
        <p>
            It’s a little different than your usual progression route.  Forestry and Extra Bees give you resources, but unless you set up quite a 
            few / go deep in with progression, you probably won’t be profiting for a while.  Also, it won’t compare at all to a quarry / resource miner. 
        </p>

        <p>
            On the upside, Career Bees gives bees a bit more leverage in a world dominated by tech mods.  They have buffs that stack with other 
            enchantments, repairing, can automate smelting/crushing, set up mining bees, farm livestock, and even accelerate other machines.
        </p>

        <h2>What do you need to get started?</h2>
        <p>
            If you’re in the early game, all you need is some wood and a bit of wool.  An early diamond and a bit of copper/tin will let you have the basics.  
            However, if you can afford to start going into Gendustry from the start, you’ll need a decent amount of resources (tin, copper, diamonds, 
            redstone and glass, as well as a healthy supply of RF(FE)) but it will take all the guesswork out of the process.  Also, you’ll want some 
            vanilla flowers (poppies, dandelions, blue orchids, etc.)
        </p>

        <h2>Biome Considerations</h2>
        <p>
            While not absolutely necessary, you may want to consider your environment before you start setting up your bee breeding area.  Most bees, particularly
            the ones from Career Bees, prefer normal / moderate climates, like those found in Plains, Forests, or Rivers (or modded ones with these characteristics).
            If you don't have access to one, there are ways around it, but it will be a bit more challenging / costly to do.
        </p>

        <p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Industrial Apiaries with Biome Upgrades</dt>
                <dd>This is the easiest fix since the environment in the apiary will simply be transformed into one the bee likes.  You can remove it when it's not needed.</dd>
                <dt>Modifying the bee with Gendustry or Binnie's Genetics</dt>
                <dd>This option isn't really feasible if you're just starting out, but it's a nice permanent fix that is passed on to the bee's descendants.</dd>
                <dt>Breeding more tolerant bees manually</dt>
                <dd>This takes a lot more time and patience, but it would also be a permanent alteration.</dd>
            </dl>
        </p>

        <p>Note that for the last two options, mutating bees in the Mutatron produces a standard bee of that type, so changes will be lost.</p>
            
        <pre> Unfixed text
            A plains-like or 
            forest-like biome will be the easiest to start in, since most bees, particularly the early ones, like that kind of temperate weather.  If you’re 
            in a very cold biome (snowy, mountainous, taiga) you’ll either be starting with Wintry bees, adding biome/temperature upgrades to your Industrial 
            Apiaries (adding to FE cost), and/or spending extra time genetically modifying your bees to adapt to the colder climate.  The same idea applies 
            to arid (hot/dry) areas (deserts, nether) and humid areas (jungle, ocean).  Most career bees prefer moderate/normal climates, so if you have access 
            to one, it will save you some trouble. 
            
            You can check out a partial list here: 

            https://ftbwiki.org/Biome (a bit more different mods listed)
            https://ftb.gamepedia.com/Biome where “Normal” temperature/humidity is ideal for your bee breeding.  Note that Mengelin biomes count as “Cold”.

            Temperature range:
            Icy => Cold => Normal => Warm => Hot => Hellish
            https://ftbwiki.org/Climate
            Humidity range:
            Arid => Normal => Damp
            https://ftbwiki.org/Humidity

            I’ll go into more detail later about troubleshooting bee issues.

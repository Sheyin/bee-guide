               <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                So, you want to learn about bees?  It can be a little intimidating at first, but it's actually quite easy to get started.  The official 
                <a href="https://forestryforminecraft.info">Forestry</a> site has a good lore-flavored guide, and it's good to know the basics, but this 
                guide will be more focused on using Gendustry and Career Bees.  The basic principles of Forestry will be covered, but Gendustry tends to 
                take away a lot of the tedium (and surprises / challenges) of bee breeding, so ultimately it’s up to you how you want to do your bees!

                <h2>Why bees?</h2>
                <p>
                    It’s a little different than your usual progression route.  Forestry and Extra Bees give you resources, but unless you set up quite a 
                    few / go deep in with progression, you probably won’t be amazed by the rate of production, though you can specify which resources
                    you want by breeding just those bees.  Also, it won’t compare at all to a quarry / resource miner.

                On the upside, Career Bees gives bees a bit more leverage in a world dominated by tech mods.  They have buffs that stack with other 
                enchantments, repairing, can automate smelting/crushing, set up mining bees, farm livestock, and even accelerate other machines.  Also,
                they're much more cost efficient, consume little power, and easy to scale for larger setups.

                <p>
                If you’re in the early game, all you need is some wood and a bit of wool to make a scoop.  An early diamond and a bit of copper/tin 
                will let you have the basics.  However, if you can afford to start going into Gendustry from the start, you’ll need a decent amount of 
                resources (tin, copper, diamonds, redstone and glass, as well as a healthy supply of RF(FE)) but it will take all the guesswork out of the 
                process.  Also, you’ll want some vanilla flowers (poppies, dandelions, blue orchids, etc.) nearby to do your breeding.

                While not absolutely necessary, you may want to consider your environment before you start setting up your bee breeding area.  Most bees, particularly
                the ones from Career Bees, prefer normal / moderate climates, like those found in Plains, Forests, or Rivers (or modded ones with these characteristics).
                If you don't have access to one, there are ways around it, but it will be a bit more challenging / costly to do.  For example, a Mengelin biome is considered
                cold, so bees preferring normal temperatures will refuse to work until they are placed in a warmer environment.

                <h2>Your First Steps:</h2>
                <p>
                The first thing you’ll want to do is make a scoop.  This is the only tool that can safely break a hive found in the wild, otherwise you’ll get nothing from breaking it.  
                It has a low amount of durability, so you may want to upgrade to the Scooporator MX200 Turbo (powered/repaired with RF) or carry around spares.
                Sometimes other modded items work, such as Buildcraft quarries, but for the most part, you’ll want a scoop.
                </p>

                <p>
                You’ll also want to consider a bag of sorts - Traveller’s Sack, satchel, ender pouch, etc.  Princesses won’t stack, so your inventory will fill up quick.  
                Also, bring a good amount of high-saturation food or some method of healing - the intended route is to use a Smoker, which can be obtained in villages or by trading
                 with an apiarist villager, but I find that it’s quicker for me to just take the health hit and heal up while travelling to my next hive.

                Note that the hives to hunt should be from Forestry or Extra Bees, and they all have the distinctive horizontal bands across the entire hive.  Hives from other mods (ex. Pam’s 
                Harvestcraft, Rustic, Animania) will not give you the bees you want for this!
                </p>

                <p>
                When you get home with bees, you’ll want at least one apiary - the one you choose depends on how much you can afford right now:
                <ul type="disc">
                    <li><b>Bee House: </b> The starter housing, cannot do mutations and cannot be automated.  Cheapest to make, or can be found in villages.  Not recommended unless you can’t afford anything else.</li>
                    <li><b>Apiary: </b> The basic housing from Forestry.  Can be automated with pipes. </li>
                    <li><b>Industrial Apiary: </b> From Gendustry, easily automatable and can be configured with upgrades as needed.  Requires RF.</li>
                    <li><b>Alveary: </b> Multiblock advanced apiary from Forestry.</li>
                </ul>

                <b>Make the Industrial Apiary if you can afford it.</b>  You don’t need to worry about the upgrades from the start, and depending on where you’re setting up your bees, you may not even need them at all.  
                The other housing units are from Forestry, and you can use Frames to affect your bees, but these will gradually be consumed over time.  For the most part I’ll be using the term “apiary” in a 
                generic sense, but assuming you’ll be making the Industrial Apiary eventually.

                There’s a good chance other people may have been in the area you’ve been searching.  Gliding or flying is helpful.  Hives give off some light, so if you’re having trouble 
                spotting them, you may have better results at nighttime.  You can also try other dimensions, as by default they can spawn in Aroma’s Mining Dimension, Lost Cities Dimension, 
                ones created via RFTools / Mystcraft, etc.

                <h2>Breaking the Hives</h2>
                <p>
                When you break a hive with the scoop, you’ll always get a princess, and sometimes a drone and/or honeycomb.  You will also take roughly 4 hearts of health damage, unaffected by armor.  The 
                princess is the most important loot from the hives - they come in two varieties, “pristine” and “ignoble”, which only really matters when trying to do force various mutations on them via Gendustry.
                
                <ul>
                <li><b>Princess (Pristine): </b> The best kind of bee. Will not die to natural causes or genetic experimentation</li>
                <li><b>Princess (Ignoble): </b> Also important, though not as great as their pristine sisters.  These have a chance to die every life cycle; also has a chance of getting killed if 
                    operated on by various Gendustry machines.  Note that while it has a chance of dying every life cycle, many times they’ll life through several real world days of constant breeding 
                    without dying out, so don’t be too worried.  Also, if in a gendustry apiary, there are upgrades to prevent this routine death.</li> 
                <li><b>Drone: </b> A male bee, relatively disposable.  You’ll need some to breed with a princess, but depending on the genes, you may end up with many more drones from one princess.  A 
                    drone is consumed when bred with a princess.  These are only used for breeding and dissolving for various machines.</li>
                <li><b>Queen: </b> An impregnated princess.  This is the stage where bee effects will happen, trees will get pollinated, etc.  When it dies (lifecycle is complete), the effects end, 
                    and a new princess and drone(s) will appear in the apiary as a result.  You will never get a Queen out in the wild, though sometimes you may find them in villages.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                Note that the only way to get pristine bees is by chance, when breaking a wild hive.  Some species will always be pristine.  Ignoble ones can be artificially created via Gendustry.  
                Other mods may offer different options as well!
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-8">
                <p>
                    To get started, you would put the princess (top) and a drone (bottom) in an apiary.  The bees will also require a flower nearby - most of the time a vanilla flower will do.  Since we're just 
                    starting out, I suggest putting in a Forest Princess and a Meadows Drone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After inserting the bees into an apiary, hopefully you’ll see a little progress bar, after which the princess and drone disappear, replaced by a queen bee.  If all is well, then there will be 
                    little bees emanating from the apiary, and possibly other effects depending on the bee.  In the apiary’s gui, you’ll see a little icon in the upper right hand corner indicating the status.  
                    You can hover over that icon for more details.  Forestry Apiaries will have a little biome image with temperature and humidity information, while Industrial Apiaries will have a green checkmark 
                    that will tell you how much energy the apiary is drawing.

                    Forest bees naturally have 3 offspring instead of the standard 2, which is very useful when manually breeding.  Provided you live in a plains/forest, this is also the safest choice, 
                    because the other basic bees have other environmental requirements that will very likely show up in the next generation or two.

                <p>
                This is not unusual!  When you open up the apiary’s gui, look in the upper right hand corner, and it will tell you what’s wrong.
                <dl>
                Not Daytime/Nighttime: Many bees only operate in the daytime, and the lifecycle is simply paused when it is night.
                Too Hot/Too Cold/Too Wet/Too Dry: The bee doesn’t like the climate you’re trying to breed it in.  This can be fixed by relocating the apiary to a suitable biome, adding upgrades to your Industrial Apiary, or modifying the bee to have a different temperature/humidity tolerance.  It may have tolerated the biome previously, but sometimes introducing different tolerances can cause them to reject the climate entirely.
                Can’t see the sky: Most bees only operate in full view of the open sky (glass is okay).  A few species will be comfortable underground or on the surface.
                Raining: Most bees don’t like the rain / snow by default.
                Flowers missing: Bees need a “flower” nearby to work.  Note that some bees require something other than your standard flower (but the warning message will still call it a flower).  For example, Jungle Bees require vines to operate.  This trait can change with breeding as well! Note that if you do add the flower, sometimes it takes a minute for the bees to recognize that it is there.  I’ve sometimes broken and re-placed Industrial Apiaries, which seems to help speed it up, but I’m not sure if it’s really a fix.
                No queen/No drone: You’re missing one of the two required bees on the left hand side to begin breeding.  Having a princess and drone in the right-hand side (results) doesn’t count! (Industrial Apiaries will show this error; Forestry ones simply won’t work)
                
                No inventory space: You’ve been using this apiary awhile and the right-hand inventory is full.  Simply remove some of the items from the right hand side, and the apiary will resume operations.  (Industrial Apiaries will show this error; Forestry ones simply won’t work)
                Not enough power: Your apiary isn’t receiving enough power.  Note that each upgrade increases the power demands.  You can see how much is needed by hovering over the icon in the upper right hand side.

                <p>
                                Remember Mendelian genetics?  Every bee is made up of multiple genes (characteristics), which are expressed by two chromosomes, one from each parent.  So if we take a look at a one bee:

                [I]w pic of pure princess / hybrid princess
                (This is by viewing a bee in the Portable Analyzer)
                <p>          
                So if you compare these princesses, one is a purebred - has all matching genes, while the other has mixed characteristics.  So the one on the left is easy - it will express all of these characteristics, but the one on the right, it will only express the ones on the left hand side (active).  The ones on the right (inactive) won’t really matter except when breeding.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In a drone, their characteristics will only matter for breeding, since the drone is immediately consumed when bred with a princess.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                So, lets say we breed a pure Forest Princess with a pure Meadows Drone.  These are the possible combinations:
                
                    Forest-Meadows		Forest-Meadows
                    Forest-Meadows		Forest-Meadows
                </p>

                <p>
                But, if we did two hybrid Forest-Meadows you could expect:
                
                    Forest-Forest			Forest-Meadows
                    Meadows-Forest		Meadows-Meadows
                </p>

                <p>
                All the characteristics will be scrambled like this after a breeding.  You can view these stats by crafting a Portable Analyzer (see below), which costs 1 drop of honey to use, though you can re-scan an identified bee as many times as you’d like afterwards.

                    <p>
                    But wait!  Certain bee combinations have the potential to mutate and turn into other species.  You can see the combinations 
                    in JEI. So pairing up a Forest and Meadows has the potential (~15%) to produce the Common trait.  So you might end up with 
                    a Forest-Meadows and a Common-Forest (or any similar combination) instead.

                    <p>
                    You can progress through the bees the intended way, and some of the bees will have certain quirks, like the hive needs to 
                    be on a particular ore, the breeding needs to take place in a particular biome, or explosions are required.  There are even 
                    frames for apiaries that will help.  However, if you’re <strike>lazy</strike> in a hurry to get to the good stuff, you’ll 
                    want to use <a href="gendustry.html">Gendustry</a> to speed things along.

                <h2>Forestry Machines:</h2>
                <p>
                There are two machines you may want to make from Forestry: the Carpenter and the Centrifuge.  The <b>Carpenter</b> will let you craft the 
                Portable Analyzer, and the <b>Centrifuge</b> will let you process the honeycombs into honey drops and other miscellaneous loot.  The Portable Analyzer
                requires a drop of honey each use, so you'll want to keep processing those honeycombs if you use the analyzer a lot.  These aren't as necessary
                if you're strictly using Gendustry and not doing any manual breeding, since you will have the ability to choose your mutations easily.  However, 
                it's very helpful if you forget what traits a particular bee has, or can't figure out what kind of flowers it wants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are working <b>without Gendustry</b>, you also will want a Squeezer to create seed oil from seeds, which is needed to make treated wood,
                    Apiaries, etc.  This also accepts modded seeds, such as those from Pam's Harvestcraft and Actually Additions's Canola Seeds.  If you are without RF, 
                    you can power these machines using a Clockwork Engine, which is basically a manual crank.

                   Forestry apiaries can be automated by extracting from the sides and re-inserting princesses / drones through the top.  The machines should all 
                   allow pipe connections as well.  Gendustry machines and apiaries can also be automated with any mod’s pipes, but you can also use
